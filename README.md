# UFOs:
a dynamic webpage with a table of UFO sightings

## Overview of Project:

A UFO enthusiast gave me the task of creating a webpage to display data from UFO sightings. I initially created a webpage that displays all UFO sightings from 2010 that the user can then filter by date. I then added more functionality. The user can now filter for five variables: date, city, state, country and shape.

## Results

To use the website, the user can simply view the table as it is or they can use the filter bar on the left side of the screen. They may choose to use all of the filters, none of the filters, or any number in between. When the user enters data in one of the fields and then clicks outside of the field, they will see the table update to match their criteria. Images below for reference.

## Summary

In its current state, the webpage is a fun tool for looking up UFO sightings; however, there is room for improvement. It could use some changes to its design and its functionality could be further increased. The filter bars may be a bit confusing for some users. For one, the table does not update until the user clicks outside the field. Users may wonder why the table doesn't change as they type since they are used to instantaneous changes in search bars and predictive text fields. Furthermore, the placeholder values in the filter fields may also confuse users. On the one hand, they are necessary to show the use how to format the data. On the other, the table does not reflect their values. Perhaps I could add "example:" in front of each placeholder value.

As mentioned, this webpage is fun, but currently lacks the functionality to make it useful for identifying trends in UFO sightings. Are UFO sightings increasing or decreasing? We can't tell with the current dataset. Expanding the dataset beyond 2010 would be the first improvement I would make. Are certain shapes of UFOs more common in some regions than others? Determining that from our table would be tedious, but if we added map functionality with each sighting and its info plotted, we might answer that question and uncover other interesting trends.
